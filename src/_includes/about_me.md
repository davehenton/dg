I'm Dylan Gattey, an iOS/API/web/everything engineer who calls San Francisco,
California home, but you already read that on the Projects page. Design is a
huge side-passion of mine outside of my day-to-day work.

My favorite thing is experimentation - I love testing things out and tinkering
away to solve problems. Open source makes that easy! I try to make the
world around me a better place, be that the web or my communities in real life.
Empathy makes everything better <3

While I don't see value in tying myself strongly to certain technologies, I'm
most accomplished in Swift. I've also worked extensively with Javascript, Java,
CSS, and Go. But you probably should check out
[my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dgattey/) if you want to know more
about that.

Some random fun facts about me: soccer is my favorite sport outside of skiing,
I'm red-green colorblind, my favorite tea is Earl Grey, I was obsessed with Zoo
Tycoon as a kid (letting out the dinosaurs!) and Sim City 4, I'm a big fan of
maps and geography, I use hella non-ironically, my favorite restaurant is in
Mexico City, and I've backpacked to Machu Picchu.
